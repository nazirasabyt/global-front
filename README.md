Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
This is a flight booking website , built with Next.js that showcases my Frontend and Backend skills.

Functionality: authentication, search and filter flights, responsive design, dynamic page routing and server side rendering




*** Live Demo : https://global-front-ds8f.vercel.app

Flight flow consists of three-levels

1.First Level: A form that searches for flights

2.Second Level: Page that lists flight options depending on the search value

3.Third Level: Payment page, shows all details of the flight and total amount to pay. Payments are possible only if authenticated so , there is a backend running to login and register as well.



ðŸ”­Currently working on connecting other providers to login , flight filtering options, payment page and error validations

this test app can only search for these flights:

"Dubai - Shri-Lanka"
"London - Moscow"
"Dubai - Bali"
"Paris - New-York"



DESIGN: taken from free figma templates

First, run the development server:

# or

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
